          Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
          simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
          together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
          development in many areas on most platforms
        The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other
          languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
        </p>


        <p>
          Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
          </li>
          <li>
            Statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
          </li>
          <li>No variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
        </ul>

          Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is just the language for you.

      <header>Hello world</header>
      <article>
        To get started with writing python, open the python IDE and write your
        first "Hello world" python code:
        <code> print("Hello Wordl!")
        </code>

        Select the code in the the ide and run it see what happened.

      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
        names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        A python identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
        dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
        python is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
        "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
        You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
        identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
        _name.

    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <article>
        You can declare a variable in easy ways:
        <p>
          With the keyword var. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>

        <p>you donot need to mention the variable type</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <article>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
        true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
        is false. An if statement looks as follows:

        <code>if (condition) :  statement_1  else :  statement_2 </code>
        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
        Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
        condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
        including further nested if statements.
        <p>
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
          conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <code>if (condition_1) : { statement_1 } elif (condition_2) : { statement_2
          } elif (condition_n): { statement_n } else: { statement_last }
        </code>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
        evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
        them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
        to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

        <code>

x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
if x < 0:
     x = 0
     print('Negative changed to zero')
 elif x == 0:
     print('Zero')
 elif x == 1:
     print('Single')
 else:
     print('More')
        
        
        
        
        </code>


        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
        because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
        the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
        assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
        additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

        <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <article>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
        evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

        <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
        statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
        statement following the loop.

        <p>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
          the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
          tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
          control is passed to the statement following while.
        </p>

        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
          those statements.
        </p>

        Example:

        <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

        <code>
 a, b = 0, 1
 while a < 1000:
     print(a, end=',')
     a, b = b, a+b



        </code>
        <p>
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: a = 0 </li>
          <li>After the second pass: a = 1 </li>
          <li>After the third pass: a = 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After completing the 1000 pass, the condition n &lt; 1000 is no longer
          less than 1000, so the loop terminates.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <article>
        A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
        statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The python statements that define the function, indented by space
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
        </p>

        <code>

      def my_function(fname):
        print(fname + " Refsnes")
        
      my_function("Emil")
      my_function("Tobias")
      my_function("Linus")

        </code>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function.
        </p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
          the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
          the calling function.
